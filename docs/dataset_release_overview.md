# Terminal Command Intelligence Dataset Release Overview

This document summarises the structure, scope, and release strategy for the Terminal Command Intelligence dataset. The goal is to produce a professional-grade, production-ready corpus containing billions of unique terminal commands and related context for training AI assistants that operate across security operations, offensive security, and systems administration domains.

## Objectives

- **Breadth of coverage**: Aggregate commands spanning Linux, Windows, and macOS, along with containerised environments and cloud CLIs.
- **Operational depth**: Capture tasks for ethical hacking, penetration testing, red teaming, blue teaming, digital forensics, secure configuration, DevSecOps automation, and threat hunting.
- **Context-rich records**: Pair each command with metadata covering provenance, licensing, task category, execution context, prerequisites, and safety notes.
- **Release-readiness**: Maintain robust documentation, validation, and governance guardrails required for enterprise distribution.

## Deliverables

1. **Dataset shards** in CSV and JSONL formats, partitioned into manageable multi-gigabyte files with deterministic naming (e.g., `commands-000001.jsonl`).
2. **Schema definitions** describing required fields, optional enrichments, and enumerations.
3. **Processing pipeline** assets (configuration, scripts, or notebooks) to reproduce the dataset from raw sources.
4. **Quality and compliance reports** demonstrating license checks, deduplication, and redaction coverage.
5. **Release documentation** (this directory) that allows downstream teams to adopt and maintain the dataset.

## Release milestones

| Milestone | Description | Exit criteria |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Data acquisition | Mirror and snapshot upstream open-source repositories, documentation portals, and training blogs. | Source registry complete with licensing metadata and sync automation. |
| Normalisation | Standardise command strings, context, and metadata into canonical schema. | Validation suite passes and schema contracts satisfied. |
| Enrichment | Add embeddings, task taxonomies, execution environments, and remediation guidelines. | Coverage thresholds met (>95% commands with environment metadata). |
| Compliance | Run legal, security, and privacy reviews. | No blocking issues; waivers documented. |
| Packaging | Produce final shards, manifests, and checksums. | Release candidate published to artefact registry. |
| Documentation | Finalise docs in `/docs` and public landing page summaries. | Documentation review sign-off complete. |

## Stakeholders

- **Data engineering**: Own ingestion, transformation, and storage pipelines.
- **Security SMEs**: Curate taxonomy, validate safety, and provide context for commands.
- **Legal & compliance**: Approve licensing usage and distribution rights.
- **ML engineering**: Consume dataset for model training and feedback on schema fitness.

## Versioning strategy

- Tag each public release using semantic versioning (e.g., `v2024.06.0`).
- Maintain change logs enumerating new sources, schema adjustments, or quality fixes.
- Provide delta releases with patch notes for incremental updates.

## Distribution channels

- Internal artefact registry (S3, GCS, or Azure Blob) with signed manifests.
- Optional external mirrors using IPFS or academic dataset hubs.
- Ensure network and API quotas for downstream continuous training pipelines.

## Support & maintenance

- Establish quarterly refresh cadence with automated anomaly detection to identify drift.
- Maintain contact lists for each stakeholder group and on-call rotation for ingestion failures.
- Track consumer issues via ticketing system with defined SLAs.

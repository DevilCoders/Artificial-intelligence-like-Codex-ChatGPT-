# Artificial-intelligence-like-Codex-ChatGPT-

An advanced custom AI model template with enhanced capabilities inspired by OpenAI Codex. This repository provides configuration and training utilities for building a large language model capable of understanding both natural language and source code across numerous programming languages.

## Features

- **Hybrid training corpora**: Mix billions of lines of open-source code (Python, JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift, TypeScript, Shell, and more) with curated natural-language corpora.
- **Large context window**: Configure tokenizers for ~14 KB Python code context to keep more of the active file in memory—over 3× GPT-3's 4 KB window.
- **Modern architecture**: Bootstraps from high-quality open checkpoints like `bigcode/starcoderbase` and enables flash attention and gradient checkpointing for efficiency.
- **Extensible pipeline**: Modular configuration objects let you adjust datasets, tokenizer, model, and training hyperparameters with ease.
- **First-class text/code processing**: Built-in preprocessor, chunker, tokenizer, encoder, and decoder components make it easy to experiment with custom data prep and model architectures without leaving the template.

## Quickstart

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -U "datasets>=2.17" "transformers[torch]>=4.38" accelerate tensorboard
   ```

2. **Review the default configuration**

   ```python
   from src.training.config import default_training_config

   cfg = default_training_config()
   print(cfg)
   ```

   Adjust dataset weights, add additional public corpora, or point to organization-internal mirrors as needed.

3. **Launch training**

   ```bash
   python -m src.training.train
   ```

   The default configuration interleaves GitHub code (`codeparrot/github-code`) and high-quality natural language (`the_pile`). Customize the dataset list to include additional sources, such as StackOverflow dumps or curated documentation corpora.

4. **Monitoring**

   Training logs stream to TensorBoard. Start a dashboard with:

   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir checkpoints/codex-like
   ```

## Customization tips

- **Tokenizer**: Provide a tokenizer checkpoint optimized for code (e.g., StarCoder or CodeLLaMA), or enable `tokenizer.use_custom=True` to train the repository's byte-level BPE tokenizer from scratch. The config automatically adds special tokens for natural-language/code demarcation and enforces a 14,336-token context length.
- **Preprocessing & chunking**: Tweak `preprocessor` and `chunker` sections of the config to normalise whitespace, strip comments, or change sliding-window sizes before tokenisation.
- **Model size**: Swap `bigcode/starcoderbase` for larger or smaller architectures that fit your compute budget, or set `model.use_custom_architecture=True` to instantiate the built-in encoder/decoder stack.
- **Scaling**: Integrate with [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) for distributed training on multi-GPU or TPU clusters. Adjust `total_batch_size` and `micro_batch_size` to saturate hardware.
- **Data governance**: Ensure that all included code repositories comply with your licensing and compliance requirements before use.

## Disclaimer

This project provides a reproducible template but does **not** ship the actual training datasets or trained checkpoints. You are responsible for sourcing data, validating licenses, and provisioning the large-scale compute necessary to train an AI coding assistant.

### Dataset release toolkit

The `/docs` directory now includes production-grade guidance for curating, validating, and distributing a multi-billion record open source code corpus suitable for training AI systems across application development, infrastructure, data engineering, and security workflows. Use the provided playbooks, schema reference, and release checklist to operationalise dataset builds. Sample CSV/JSONL shards in `/data` demonstrate the canonical schema, metadata richness, and partitioning strategy expected in production releases.
